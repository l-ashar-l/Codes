# MERN Stack

### MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications.


### MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: 

- MongoDB 
- Express
- React 
- Node.js. 
 
*It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.*


__MongoDB:__
> Cross-platform Document-Oriented Database

MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. MongoDB is flexible and allows its users to create schema, databases, tables, etc.

__Express:__
> Back-End Framework

Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code. Express helps in designing great web applications and APIs.

__React:__
>Front-End Library

React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data.

__Node:__
> Javascript Runtime Environment

Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser). Node pack manager i.e. npm allows the user to choose from thousands of free packages (node modules) to download.
